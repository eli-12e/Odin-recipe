        <h2>Description</h2>
    <p><strong>The dish, which is also called Murgh Makhani in Hindi, is without question the most popular dish to
            emerge from
            India; it may even be one of the most popular dishes in the world. If you are just going to an Indian
            restaurant
            for the first time, your friends will likely recommend it as a starting place. Its mildly spicy, creamy,
            savoury
            flavour makes it more than just delicious, but accessible to almost every palate.
        </strong></p>
    <p><strong>
            Butter chicken originated in Delhi, the capital territory of India, sometime during the 1950s. During this
            time,
            a man named Kundan Lal Gurjal operated a restaurant in the city, called Moti Mahal. Kundan had settled here
            and
            started his business after fleeing from political upheaval in another region of India. Moti Mahal was a
            success,
            serving many delightful tandoori dishes (a tandoor is a circular clay oven, and can be found in any Indian
            restaurant worth its salt).
